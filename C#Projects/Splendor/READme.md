Splendor has always been my favorite game so much so that I decided to build it for my first ever c# application. After acquiring support from helpful sources I was able to make something that I was proud of and wanted to share. Enjoy!

## Requirements

- Compatible with Windows, macOS, and Linux

## Running the Application

```bash
dotnet run
```

The application will be available at https://localhost:7135 (or the URLs specified in Properties/launchSettings.json)

## Building for Production

dotnet build --configuration Release
```

## Installation

brew install --cask dotnet-sdk
```
